Django Full-Stack Trading Bot Project
Overview
This project is a 2-hour guided full-stack web application built using the Django framework. The main focus is on Django migrations to define and manage database structures. Instead of emphasizing frontend templates, this project dives deep into the backend, providing a solid foundation for handling real-world data structures.

Project Goal
The mission is to develop a proof of concept (PoC) for an investment product that helps non-investors understand currency exchange. The bot automatically monitors exchange rates between two currencies and executes a transaction when the rate reaches a favorable threshold—mimicking real-world currency exchange companies.

Key Features
✅ Django Project Setup with Admin UI
✅ Database Management using Django Migrations
✅ Automated Currency Exchange Bot
✅ Rollback Buggy Migrations
✅ Dashboard to Display Portfolio Balance

Project Scope
Develop a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for the trading bot
Implement Django migrations (including an empty migration with pre-inserted data)
Roll back migrations in case of issues
Render a real-time portfolio balance dashboard
